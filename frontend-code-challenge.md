# Frontend Code Challenge

To complete this challenge, you will need to write a simple React based web app, and provide us the source files to be built.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your skills and approach to composing a simple web app given a screen and an API feed. We will also assess the generated HTML, CSS, and JS output.

Refer to the [search view page](search-bar-functionality.pdf) screen. This will be your index.html screen.

Create a search box that will provide ranked suggestions pulled from [this sample JSON feed](sample.json). The suggestions should be ranked based on the score returned. Refer to the attached search screen. Each result should return at least the name.
